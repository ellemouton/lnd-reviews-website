## Notes

* Understand the setup for itest, including the miner, the chain backend, and the lnd nodes.

## Questions

* A broad and open question, why do you think our itest builds are failing?
* How many chain backends, db backends, OS, and miner backends are we testing?
* What challenges were you faced writing itest?
* What are the issues of our current itest regarding its maintainability and code health?
* What's your suggestion about creating PRs when bringing an inherently large change?
* What are the pros and cons of creating the temporary package lntemp?
* What's the most time-consuming step when running the test cases?
* How to make our itest run faster?
