## Notes

* This is a medium sized pure refactor PR.
* There should be no behaviour change from this PR.

## Questions

* What is the purpose of the `server` struct in `server.go`? How does it differ from `rpcServer` in `rpcserver.go`?
* What does refactoring mean in this context?
* What are the advantages of refactoring code in this way (extracting into packages/structs)?
* What are the risks of such refactor changes?
* Where is the affected code tested? Before and after the PR?
* What's the biggest challenge for reviewers when reviewing a refactor PR?
* Why is a clean commit structure especially important for a refactor PR?
* How would you structure such a refactor PR?
* How can a reviewer test the code changes?
