* What is a 'sink' node?
* What problems could a user face when opening a channel to a sink node?
* Why do we need the boolean fields UseBaseFee UseFeeRate in the updated OpenChannelRequest?
* What options do we have for adding new fields to existing DB objects?
* What do we want to store and for how long?
* Where are we storing the feerates?
* With regards to the channel funding flow, when and in what message do we send the feerates?
