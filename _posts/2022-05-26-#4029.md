## Notes

* Coin Selection is the procedure that selects UTXOs ("coins") from the wallet

## Questions

* What in your own words would you expect that a `fundmax` flag should do in the call to OpenChannel?
* Why seems adding a `fundmax` flag to the OpenChannel command a bit more complex compared to e.g. the `sweepall` flag of the SendCoins command?
* Can you identify independent code changes to LND that required additional attention in this PR (list some of the requirements that has to be correctly handled)?
* What is a concurrency issue that all funding logic must consider? How is that generally handled in the LND codebase?
* What checks are in place to prevent incorrect funding of a channel (can be already existing ones or checks introduced with this PR)?
* How is PR#4588 related to this PR?
