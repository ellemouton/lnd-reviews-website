## Notes

* Understand the [ConcurrentQueue](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/queue/queue.go)

## Questions

* What suggestions do you have for first time contributors?
* What's the difference between SubscribePayment and SubscribeAllPayments?
* What data structure is used to hold items in a ConcurrentQueue?
* Will sending items to the queue (subscriber.queue.ChanIn() <- payment) ever be blocked?
* What go type is used to hold the subscribers in controlTower and can we use a different one?
* Do we have a limit on the number of max subscribers allowed?
* When we subscribe the payments, we need to register the subscriber and fetch inflight payments. Does the order matter here? What did the auther choose and what's the tradeoff here?
* Why is logging important?
