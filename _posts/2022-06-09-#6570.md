## Notes

* Check the kvdb package: what interface does it provide? Where is the bolt implementation for that interface?
* Check the lncfg/db.go to see how configuration and initialization happens.
* If youâ€™re not familiar with sqlite, check the https://sqlite.org/index.html website.
* If you are not familiar with the concept of key value databases, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database.


## Questions

* Why specifically do you think we need sqlite support in LND?
* How does LND support so many different database backends?
* How is a specific backend selected and instantiated?
* Does everything need to be in one sqlite database?
* How does sqlite integration in Go work?
* Do database operations in LND happen concurrently?
* Will I be able to query my tables and observe changes using my favorite sqlite browser?
